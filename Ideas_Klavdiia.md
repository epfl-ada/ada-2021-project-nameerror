<h3> Milestone 1

Idea 1. The Quotebank dataset can be used to make a tool for voters to help them decide what candidate is the most reliable. Often people do not want to read the election program due to the lack of time or interest or because sometimes the program is far from reality. It is much better to look at the real actions and/or ideas of a candidate, his/her reactions in a specific situation, and solutions that the candidate once provided to a really occurred problem. The voter can search this information on different websites and newspapers, but it can be very time and energy-consuming. The Quotebank dataset allows the voter to find the quotations of the candidate and the quotations of other people about the candidate fast to make a considered decision. For example, we have a businessman who wants to run for a high post. He speaks a lot about environmental pollution and the importance of alternative energy sources, but, at the same time, we find from the Quotebank dataset that he invests in oil companies. So we can conclude that this candidate may not be reliable enough because his words about ecology are simply hype.

Idea 2. The Quotebank dataset can be a good source of information for some sociological and psychological investigations that aim to figure out what characteristics of a person and the social environment can (on an unconscious level) influence the decisions that this person makes, i.e., the personality. On the Quotebank, we can find reactions and opinions of different politicians, economists, and people of other professions on a specific problem. Then we can try to group these quotations and find the relation to such characteristics as gender, age, social and marital status, income, the origin of a speaker, etc. For instance, we can (probably) figure out who (male or female leaders) usually give the more sounding promises, what global issues interest them most, and who keep the promises more often. Maybe we will determine that there are no such connections.

Idea 3 (the craziest one). The Quotebank dataset seems to help find the origin of coronavirus. It could be achieved by looking for the earliest mentions of a new virus, unusual pneumonia and flu cases in the quotations of people from different countries.

<h4> Feedback: Needs minor improvements

Overall, the ideas are creative and varied. Here are some comments and observations, hope you find them useful :)

Idea 1: I liked how you motivate why it is relevant; however, it would be great if you could start formulating research questions to guide your work. Are the biases in Quotebank dataset? How would these biases influence your results?

Idea 2: This is a creative and well-described idea. It would be great if you started thinking about possible ways (methods) to answer your questions. You could also link this to Hofstedeâ€™s cultural dimensions theory if you do the analysis per country.

Idea 3: What is your hypothesis? This idea, in comparison to the previous ones, lacks description and motivation. Maybe the word origin is misused, do you mean the first cases?
