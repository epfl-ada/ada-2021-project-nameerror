# Ideas

The Quotebank dataset contains quotes from recent years. This represents a great opportunity to better understand politics and the media. Here are three ideas on this subject.


## 1. A better understanding of the political landscape

Such a dataset could bring much information about the political sphere, because it links politicians to the ideas they convey through speeches and declarations.

Firstly, analysing the content of quotes (lexical analysis, emotions, topics and themes discussed...) and the whole bank produce data about the individuals. For example, we could match politicians to their main topics, media presence, simplicity of language, emotions conveyed depending on the themes...

Secondly, these indicators might help to build communities among these people, and have a better understanding of their relationships and groups. Tools like Gephi export constellation views, which are very meaningful for the public.

Thirdly, all these quotes tell things about the media relaying them too. Thanks to WikiData, information about the speakers can be retrieved (political party, domains of expertise, gender...) and help understanding why they have been quoted by a newspaper (what it means about it) and drawing a map of all media (and related politicians). And let's link that with time and find out who helped Donald Trump to become president ! By analysing the contexts, we could also see how politicians are portrayed / introduced by the different media (positivity, mistrust, criticism...)


## 2. Timeline of some elections

Another interesting thing that can be done is mix this quotation dataset with other relevant ones. For example, put in parallel the political debate (represented through quotes, media presence, and more) and the political polls during an election. We can imagine putting in parallel the evolution among candidates, and the main topics discussed to see which one helped which candidate. Let's see the relationship between voting intentions and media presence, pivotal moments and key quotes... I agree it is not guaranteed we can find anything relevant, but it's worth a try.


## 3. Spread of topics and talking points

Let's analyse the topics of the quote again and make the following assumption: the date of the quotes are actually consistent with the date people said them. We first can try to show the evolution of topics (kind of like the Quotebank webapp tool, but we should be able to identify topics), but we can go further. It would be interesting to track the propagation of these themes across all speakers and/or media. It's easy to imagine beautiful representations of it, with graphs and videos to show the diffusion above time. The initiators of the topics discussed should be noticeable.

Rather than focusing on topics, it would be interesting to better understand, quantify and represent the "talking points" phenomena, which are often used by politicians. For example, these talking points are formulas, adjectives, complete sentences, specific terms that are shared in a political group or party and (abusively) reused by their spokespersons or press secretaries.


# Feedback

Feedback: Needs improvements

Overall, the ideas are interesting but not very developed. Here are some comments and observations, hope you find them useful :)

Idea 1: I liked how you motivate why it is relevant; however, it would be great if you could start formulating research questions to guide your work.

Idea 2: Good visualisation idea. You could go further in the analysis by looking into graph community detection. You could identify the communities and try to understand what they have in common.

Idea 3: Here again you could gain insight using unsupervised methods (clustering).
